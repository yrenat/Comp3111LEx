Part1: [Book.java]

package Lab2b;

public class Book {
    private String chapters[];
    private static final int DEFAULT_CHAPTERS = 10;

    public Book() {
        chapters = new String[DEFAULT_CHAPTERS];
        for (int i = 0; i < chapters.length; i++) {
            chapters[i] = "n/a";
        }
    }
    public Book(String argument[]) {
        chapters = argument;
    }
    public String getChapter(int i) {
        return chapters[i];
    }
    public String[] getChapters() {
        return chapters;
    }

}



Part2: [MobileComputer.java]

package Lab2c;
public class MobileComputer extends Computer implements Chargeable{
    private int battery;
    public MobileComputer() {
        secret = "MobileComputer secret";
        battery = 5;
    }
    @Override
    public void work() {
        if (battery > 0) {
            System.out.println("It is working on my lap.");
            battery--;
        } else
            System.out.println("Running out of battery");
    }
    @Override
    public void charge() {
        if (battery < 10)
            battery++;
    }

}

Explanation: 
The bug is caused by inheritance. In mainApp2c.java, MobileComputer m is being called as Chargeable, while indeed it's not a Chargeable. So I use the keyword "implements" and add "implements chargeable" to MobileComputer to inherit all members and methods from its parent class Chargeable. After that, the polymorphism can be performed correctly.
